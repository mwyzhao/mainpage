First thing I'm going to do is add Google Analytics to the site.

I went and made a Google Analytics account to get the ID needed to pass to the Javascript I need to run on the pages in order to collect analytics for the site. This can then be accomplished in Hugo by adding the predefined template line to a file that says what should go into the header of every single HTML page generated by Hugo. Analytics takes 24-48 hours to show up in Google Analytics so I'm excited to see what shows up.

On another note, something is messed up with the formatting of this site since I envisioned the "This Website" section to be under the "Threads" section but I haven't found out the proper way to do that with my Hugo template yet. Will fix that later.
