It's been a while since I updated here, about 40 days to be exact. I haven't stopped with this project, I've just been working on something else for the last month or so. For the last half of this month I was working designing and publishing a site for an open source project. You can find the published site [here](https://lex-talionis.net).

It was quite the journey over the span of roughly 3 weeks going from just an idea, to design mocks, to choosing a template, to customizing said template, and finally putting on all the polish that was required to meet the communities expectations.

Some tools I picked up along the way that I hope in some way I can also apply to my future changes to this site as well:

- Mocking in Figma
- Setting up a static site hosted on Gitlab
- Learned Hugo in semi-indepth
- Learned a little bit about TailwindCSS and Javascript
- Learned about Google Search Console, Ahref, and SEO in general

So what's different? What's different is as a part of my exploration of this open source project I've also gotten into game development in the past few weeks.

New stuff I've come in contact with include:

- Pygame
- Putting my rusty Python knowledge to use
- Spriting and animating with Aseprite
- Briefly looked at DAWs like LMMS

I hope to put together all of these to bring some of the ideas I have knocking around in my head to life. It might not be sensical at the moment but here's a sneak peek.

In the future updates on my game dev endeavors will go in another thread, which will give me some much needed motivation to finally fix the broken threads page now that I actually understand how Hugo templating works.
