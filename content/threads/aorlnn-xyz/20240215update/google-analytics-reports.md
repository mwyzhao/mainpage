After a week of running Google Analytics, I've finally decided to check on what it has to offer. Looking at the User Attributes Overview under Reports of the dashboard provided by Google Analytics, I can see over the course of the last week I had two visitors from Toronto, Canada and two visitors coming from the US/Russia. Considering the two visitors from Toronto are definitely me looking at my own website on my PC and phone, and the others likely being bots or crawlers, that means literally 0 people have visited my site! This is great news because it's in such shabby condition I'd rather keep it out of public view anyway.

Although there is literally no human being coming to my site, this week I am also adding a contact form. I am hoping to start early to encourage contact and conversation. Everything short of actually promoting my work on social media that is ðŸ˜‰. I don't think I want to do that until I have something worthwhile to share. Even then, I want to start early mentally having a priority on contact and conversation. To that end I plan to add this basically at the bottom of most content from now on but while I figure out how to best do that I'm gonna keep it in it's own contact page for now.

The Ananke template I'm using for Hugo (my static site generator) already has a template to link to a Formspree url which I can use to collect email messages for free. This has the added benefit of hiding my own email address, not that my actual contact information isn't easily searchable for a motivated person. I plan on linking to my Twitter (X), Discord, and maybe other socials in the future but for now it's just this contact form.

As part of the default (read: _free_) configuration for Fromspree you'll need to provide your own email address to contact me and I seem to have no way to customize anything, so for the shy people out there I am also working out a way to contact me anonymously.

I am also planning to add comments likely with Disqus similar to what I did with Formspree, though I would like there to be no sign up required for it. This will need further looking into. Also still need to fix the site organization, especially the This Website page not being under Threads as mentioend in the last post.

For those of you who are inclined, I'll also put the contact form right here! Please send any comments and suggestions my way. Look forward to hearing from you!
