I wanted to showcase somethings that I work on that doesn't seem to be readily available on the internet: a thread of work in a project where one action builds up on the base created by previous actions. All too often people see a fully finished polished product but never learn about the trials and tribulations of the development process. It's not glamorous or sexy (and there may be no demand for it at all) but I hope maybe I can shed some light shed on the hard work it takes to learn and grow.
