The idea behind this post is that seeing your peers who you perceive to be similar to yourself go out there and try new things, it allows you to release yourself from the prison of your own making and allows you to do something similar. I think it sounds very obvious just reading this, but I think the need to feel like you are worthy enough to do something outside of your own perceived role is a real problem that many people struggle with.

In the last few years when I experienced the most aversion to starting as well as the most stress associated with it, I realized a big portion of it was due to looking at people that I didn’t know at all doing things I aspired to do at a high level. I end up thinking they were all superhuman and I am nothing like them, therefore I could never even attempt to do what they do. However as the years pass and more of my peers become unhappy with how they were living, some of them began to start doing things that I assumed was impossibly hard back then. Some of them started streaming video games, some of them became started publicly sharing lifestyle posts on Instagram, others started uploading covers and original tracks to Youtube. Although it can’t be said that they were all successful in what they were doing, depending on your definition of successful, it can be said that they all managed to find something that they were passionate enough to consistently do and enjoy for some period of time.

The idea that someone close to you that was not much different from you could go achieve something you believed you could never achieve yourself is strangely liberating. Whoever it is that might read this post in the future, I want to say that you don’t have to be locked in to the role you see for yourself. If you have the time, then do something you’ve been putting off and get that first step in. No one is stopping you from starting on your journey to become who you aspire to be except yourself.

Whatever you do, just be ready to put in the work and enjoy the journey.
