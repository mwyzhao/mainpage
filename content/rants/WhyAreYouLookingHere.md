In the last few years when I experienced the most aversion to starting as well as the most stress associated with it, I realized a big portion of it was due to looking at people that I didnâ€™t know becoming successful and thinking that I am nothing like them, and that I could never do what they did. For some people it is true, not everyone is meant to become ultra-successful whether it be to a lack of luck or talent. However as the years pass and more of my peers become unhappy with how they were living, some of them began to start doing things that I assumed were impossibly hard. Some of them started seriously streaming video games, some of them became successful instagram influencers, others started uploading covers and original tracks to youtube. While it is obvious to anyone in hindsight, probably not a single one of them went into it knowing or even expecting to become successful. The ones I talked to all said that it started out as a hobby.
